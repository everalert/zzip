- "The series of [local file header][encryption header][file data][data descriptor]
   repeats for each file in the .ZIP archive"
   - local file header   always
   - encryption header   only if encryption used
   - file data           only if file type has content (i.e. skip for directories, zero-byte files, etc.)
   - data descriptor     necessary if flag bit 3 is set, optional? otherwise

- files in a zip archive contain the full relative path in the 'filename' field
- some zip archives have entries for both the directories and the files in them
  (e.g. 'images/001.png' -> entries for both 'images' and 'images/001.png')
- having directories as separate entries is not necessary for a valid archive
