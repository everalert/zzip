# ZZIP

**Library for working with the ZIP archive format in Zig.**

Written using Zig 0.11.0.

**Disclaimer:** ZZIP was written out of a need for my own use case, and is minimally featured to support a subset of the PKZip 2.0 spec. While I plan to expand this project to support the full spec and update it for compatibility with new Zig versions, I may not do so in a timely manner.
